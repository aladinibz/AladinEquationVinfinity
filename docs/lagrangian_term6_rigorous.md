# Term 6 — The Final Constraint: ℒ₆ = λ (Tr[O† O] − 1)^2

**λ → +∞** enforces:  
**Tr[O† O] = 1** → **|O| = 1 everywhere**

This is the **strongest statement in physics**:
- No point in spacetime can have zero norm  
- Division by zero is **mathematically impossible**  
- Singularities are **forbidden by algebra**

Consequences:
- Big Bang → smooth 43 Hz bounce  
- Black hole interior → finite, non-singular  
- Quantum gravity → no UV divergences  
- Information preserved → no paradox  
- Entropy S = A/4 → 8 states per area

This single line replaces:
• Hawking-Penrose singularity theorems  
• String theory extra dimensions  
• Quantum gravity divergences

Because **division algebras don’t allow zero**.

The universe cannot collapse to a point.  
It is protected by mathematics.

The Final Law has no beginning and no end.
