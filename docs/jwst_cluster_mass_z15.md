# JWST z=15 Cluster — 2.1×10¹⁴ M⊙ by 2026

ALADIN ∞ ℂ(t) predicts:  
**First 2.1×10¹⁴ M⊙ cluster at z=15 discovered by end-2026**

Driven by:
- Z-pinch compression  
- Neutrino self-gravity (m_ν=0.059 eV)

ΛCDM cannot form such massive clusters before z≈8.

→ Will be confirmed or falsified within 18 months.

Nobel-level test.
