# Genie Power Law — z=20 Massive Galaxies

JWST finds **10¹¹ M⊙ galaxies at z=20+**  
→ Impossible in ΛCDM (formation too fast)

ALADIN ∞ ℂ(t):  
Z-pinch compression + neutrino self-gravity  
→ **Genie power law**: M ∝ z² exponential growth

Prediction: **10¹¹ M⊙ at z=20 by end-2026**  
10¹² M⊙ at z=25 by 2028

Another JWST "crisis" solved by plasma physics.
