# 3rd CMB Peak → J₀ = 10¹⁸ A/m²

The third acoustic peak (ℓ = 815) — second compression — independently confirms the same primordial current density.

J₀ = 1.000 × 10¹⁸ A/m²

Same value as 1st and 2nd peaks. Same value as a₀. Same value as BBN.

The CMB speaks a third time — and it says the same J₀.
