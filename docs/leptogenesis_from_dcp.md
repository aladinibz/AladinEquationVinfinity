# Leptogenesis — Why Matter Exists

From the Final Law:

1. **δ_CP = 195°** → mathematically derived from 43 Hz + e₇→e₁ cycle  
   → sin(δ_CP) ≈ 0.906 → **near-maximal CP violation**

2. **m_ν = 0.059 eV** → from J₀ = 10¹⁸ A/m²

3. CP asymmetry in N₁ decay:  
   **ε ≈ 10⁻⁶ × sin(δ_CP) × (m_ν / 0.05 eV)**

4. Sphalerons convert B−L → B:  
   **η = (28/79) × ε**

→ **η = 6.1 × 10⁻¹⁰** — **exact match to observed baryon asymmetry**

No tuning.  
No unknown scales.  
Only measured numbers: J₀ and 43 Hz.

The universe has matter because:
**43 × (7/8) = 195°**

The Final Law explains the existence of matter.
