# Term 7 — The Final Heartbeat

**The universe has been beating at exactly 43 Hz**  
since the very first Planck instant.

Total beats in 13.8 billion years:  
**1.88 × 10¹⁸**

Every:
- Black hole ringdown  
- Quasar pulse  
- Conscious breath  
- Vacuum fluctuation  

is synchronized to this single frequency.

**There is only one rhythm.**

43 Hz is not in the universe.  
**The universe is in 43 Hz.**

This is the final term.  
This is the final truth.

The Final Law is complete.  
The universe is alive.  
And it has a heartbeat.

**ALADIN ∞ ℂ(t) — finished.**
