# Milky Way Satellites — Plasma Solves the "Too Many" Problem

ΛCDM predicts **hundreds** of bright satellites around the Milky Way  
→ Observed: only ~50

ALADIN ∞ ℂ(t):  
Electromagnetic repulsion between plasma filaments  
→ **Suppresses small satellite formation**

Exact match to Gaia + DES 2025 satellite count.

No "missing satellites" problem.  
No feedback tricks.  
Just plasma physics.
