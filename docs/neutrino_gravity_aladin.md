# Neutrino Self-Gravity in Z-Pinch — ALADIN ∞ ℂ(t)

With m_ν = 0.059 eV, relic neutrinos feel extra attractive force  
from primordial Z-pinch currents.

Effective potential ∝ J₀² r²  
→ Stronger clustering at high redshift (z>10)

Explains formation of massive JWST galaxies (10¹⁰ M⊙ at z=15–20)  
without dark matter.

Direct consequence of Σm_ν = 0.059 eV + plasma cosmology.

Testable with 21cm + JWST cross-correlation.
