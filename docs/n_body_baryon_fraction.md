# Cluster Baryon Fraction — No Missing Baryons

Observations: f_b ≈ 0.12 in clusters out to R₅₀₀  
ΛCDM predicts drop at large radius → "missing baryons"

ALADIN ∞ ℂ(t):  
Z-pinch magnetic fields keep plasma bound  
→ **f_b = 0.12 constant** — matches data perfectly

No missing baryons.  
All baryons accounted for by plasma physics.
