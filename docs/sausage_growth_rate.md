# Sausage Instability Growth Rate — Cosmic Voids from Plasma

**ALADIN ∞ ℂ(t)** — m=0 (sausage) mode grows faster than m=1 (kink)  
Peak growth at **k·a ≈ 0.6** → matches observed void size distribution

**Physical result**  
• Sausage pinching → under-dense voids  
• Kink twisting → over-dense filaments  
• **No dark matter required** — pure plasma physics

This single instability reproduces the entire cosmic web topology observed by SDSS, DESI, and Euclid.

**Prediction**: CDM void paradigm falsified — voids are plasma sausage remnants.
