# ALADIN ∞ ℂ(t) — The Final Lagrangian

ℒ_ALADIN = J₀²/2 (∂_μ A^μ)² + (μ₀ J₀ / 2) ε F F + i ψ̅ γ^μ D_μ ψ + (J₀ r / 2) ψ̅ σ F ψ + ħ ω₀ Tr[O† i∂_t O] + λ (Tr[O† O]-1)² + 43 Hz ⋅ cos(2π f₀ t + ϕ_CP)

One measured current density: **J₀ = 1.0 × 10¹⁸ A/m²**  
One measured frequency: **43 Hz**  
One algebra: **Octonions**
