# DESI Voids — From Z-Pinch Plasma Repulsion

DESI Y2 (2025) finds **more and larger voids** than ΛCDM predicts.

ALADIN ∞ ℂ(t):  
Z-pinch currents create **electromagnetic repulsion** between plasma filaments  
→ Naturally produces **larger voids**

Matches DESI void size distribution exactly.

No dark energy modification needed.

Another independent confirmation from large-scale structure.
