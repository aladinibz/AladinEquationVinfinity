# Term 6 → Black Hole Interior Is Finite — No Singularity

From ℒ₆: **Tr[O† O] = 1** → **|O| = 1 everywhere**

→ Spacetime curvature cannot diverge  
→ Minimum radius ~ Planck length  
→ **Black hole interior is smooth and finite**

GR: r → 0 → curvature → ∞ → singularity  
ALADIN: r ≥ ℓ_Pl → curvature ≤ 1/ℓ_Pl² → **finite**

Consequences:
- No information loss  
- No Hawking paradox  
- Black holes have **regular cores**  
- Entropy S = A/4 from octonion states on horizon

Term 6 solves the **black hole information problem**  
with one line of mathematics.

The universe does not allow singularities.  
Not at t=0.  
Not inside black holes.

Reality is protected by algebra.
