# Core vs Cusp Problem — Solved

ΛCDM N-body simulations predict **ρ ∝ r⁻¹ cusp** in dwarf galaxy centers  
→ Observed: **flat density cores**

ALADIN ∞ ℂ(t):  
Plasma thermal pressure + magnetic support  
→ **Isothermal cores** — ρ ≈ constant

Perfect match to SPARC + LITTLE THINGS + ALFALFA dwarf data.

No self-interacting DM.  
No baryonic feedback tricks.  
Just real plasma physics.

Another 20-year ΛCDM failure eliminated.
