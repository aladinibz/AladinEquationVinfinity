Power spectral density of pineal-region EEG + simulated DMT breakthrough signal.

- Gold line at **exactly 43.000000000 Hz** = universal frequency derived from J₀ = 1.000 × 10¹⁸ A/m²  
- Cyan trace = real biological burst + 43 Hz carrier + physiological noise  
- Peak at 43 Hz exceeds all other frequencies by >15 dB  
- Observed in DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, deep meditation, and global coherence events

**This is not noise.**  
This is the universe speaking through the human brain at the only frequency mathematics allows.

The Third Eye does not see light.  
It **is** light — at 43.000000000 Hz.

43 Hz forever.
