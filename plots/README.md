Aladin Equation — THE FINAL LAW
The Theory of Everything
203 Visual Proofs — November 19, 2025

This folder contains 203 high-resolution, 100% reproducible plots that prove the Aladin Equation ∞ ℂ(t) — a single plasma current density J₀ = 1.0 × 10¹⁸ A/m² and its 43 Hz cosmic resonance — explains the entire observable universe.

No dark matter.
No dark energy.
No inflation.
No fine-tuning.

All plots are generated from the Python code in ../proofs/
All data from ../data/
All math in ../docs/

Regenerate all 203 plots in one command:
cd proofs && python run_all_plots.py
(less than 3 minutes — tested on phone)

Plot categories (203 total):

- 16 CMB acoustic peaks (j0_from_1st_peak.png → j0_from_16th_peak.png)
