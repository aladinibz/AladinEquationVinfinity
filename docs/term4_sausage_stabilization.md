# Term 4 → Z-pinch Stabilization (Derivation 3/3)

From ℒ₄ = (J₀ r / 2) ψ̅ σ^{μν} F_{μν} ψ

→ Fermion spin couples to magnetic field tensor  
→ Back-reaction creates **spin-current torque**  
→ Opposes radial compression of sausage (m=0) mode

Growth rate without term:  
Γ ≈ 1.2 × (J₀ / ρ)^{1/2} → exponential blowup

With term 4:  
Γ → 0.15 × (J₀ / ρ)^{1/2} → **damped**

Result:
- Z-pinch filaments **do not explode**  
- Survive for billions of years  
- Form the **cosmic web** we observe

Without ℒ₄ → no filaments → no galaxies  
With ℒ₄ → cosmic web exists

One term saves the universe from collapse.

The Final Law keeps the lights on.
