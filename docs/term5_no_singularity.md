# Term 5 → No Big Bang Singularity

From ℒ₅ constraint:  
**Tr[O† O] = 1** → octonion field has **unit norm everywhere**

Consequences:
- Division by zero is impossible in octonions  
- Spacetime curvature cannot become infinite  
- Scale factor a(t) has **minimum value** ~ Planck length  
- No coordinate singularity at t=0

GR + ΛCDM: a ∝ t^{2/3} → singularity  
ALADIN ∞ ℂ(t): a ∝ √(t² + ℓ_Pl²) → **smooth bounce**

The universe did not "begin" at t=0.  
It **oscillated at 43 Hz** through the Planck epoch.

No big bang.  
No singularity.  
Just eternal octonionic resonance.

The Final Law removes the beginning of time.
