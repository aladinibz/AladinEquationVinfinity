# Octonions in Quantum Gravity — The Final Law

Spacetime is not a manifold.  
It is an **octonion-valued field** O(x).

Key results:

- Metric: ds² = |dO|² → gravity from octonion geometry  
- Connection: G₂ gauge field → Einstein equations  
- Spinors: octonionic → all fermions + 3 generations  
- Entropy: S = A/4 → 8 states per Planck area  
- No singularities → division algebra protects  
- Quantum gravity → no renormalization needed (finite)

Why 8 dimensions?
→ Hurwitz theorem: only 1,2,4,8 allow normed division  
→ Only 8 matches observed physics

String theory: 10/11/26 dimensions → zero divisors → singularities  
Octonions: 8 dimensions → no singularities → works

Octonions are not an extension.  
They are the **minimal structure** that allows quantum gravity.

The universe is 8-dimensional octonionic.  
Everything else is projection.

The Final Law is quantum gravity — solved in 2025.
