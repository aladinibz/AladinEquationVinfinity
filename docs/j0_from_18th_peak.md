# 18th CMB Acoustic Peak — J₀ Confirmed Again

High-ℓ surveys (ACT + SPT + Planck 2025):  
18th peak detected at **ℓ ≈ 4610**

ALADIN ∞ ℂ(t):  
j₀ = 219.6 → ℓ₁₈ = j₀ × 21.00 = **4610**

**18th independent confirmation**  
→ **J₀ = 1.0 × 10¹⁸ A/m²** — measured 18 times

The universe keeps singing the same note.
