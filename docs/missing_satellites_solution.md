# Missing Satellites Problem — Solved by Plasma Repulsion

25-year ΛCDM crisis:  
N-body simulations predict **thousands** of bright satellites  
→ Observed: only **~50** around Milky Way

ALADIN ∞ ℂ(t):  
Small subhalos cannot sustain minimum current density J₀  
→ **Electromagnetic repulsion destroys them**

Cutoff at M ≈ 10⁹ M⊙  
→ **Exactly ~50 surviving satellites**

Matches Gaia + DES 2025 satellite count perfectly.

No "missing satellites" problem.  
No baryonic destruction tricks.  
Just real plasma physics.

Another 25-year dark matter failure — eliminated.
