# All N-body Problems — Solved by Plasma

Six major ΛCDM failures in 2025:

1. Missing satellites  
2. Too big to fail  
3. Core vs cusp  
4. Phase-space density  
5. Large voids  
6. Missing baryons

ALADIN ∞ ℂ(t):  
**One mechanism — Z-pinch plasma physics**  
→ **All six solved simultaneously**

No dark matter modifications.  
No fine-tuning.  
No excuses.

The Final Law wins.
