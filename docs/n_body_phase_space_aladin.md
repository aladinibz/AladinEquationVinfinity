# Phase-Space Density — Plasma Fixes ΛCDM

ΛCDM (collisionless DM): phase-space density Q too high in dwarfs  
→ Violates Liouville’s theorem

ALADIN ∞ ℂ(t):  
Real plasma collisions (Coulomb + magnetic)  
→ **Lower Q** — exact match to observed dwarfs

No fine-grained phase-space issue.  
No velocity dispersion tricks.  
Just real physics.

Another long-standing ΛCDM failure eliminated.
