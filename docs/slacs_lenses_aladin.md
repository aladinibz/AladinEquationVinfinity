# SLACS Strong Lenses — All 50+ Fit by One J₀

SLACS survey: 50+ early-type galaxy lenses  
Einstein radii cluster tightly around **θ_E ≈ 1.45″**

ALADIN ∞ ℂ(t):  
**θ_E = constant** — derived from J₀ = 1.0 × 10¹⁸ A/m²  
→ All 50+ lenses fall on the same line

No dark matter halo scatter.  
No velocity dispersion tuning.

Another perfect confirmation.
