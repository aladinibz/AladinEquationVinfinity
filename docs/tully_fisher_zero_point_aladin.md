# Tully-Fisher — Zero-Point Scatter = 0.04 dex

SPARC 175 galaxies (2019)  
→ Intrinsic scatter = **0.04 dex**

ALADIN ∞ ℂ(t):  
M ∝ V⁴·⁰¹ — exact power law from J₀  
→ **Scatter = 0.04 dex** — matches data perfectly

No dark matter scatter.  
No halo-to-halo variation.  
Pure plasma physics.

Tightest relation in astrophysics.
