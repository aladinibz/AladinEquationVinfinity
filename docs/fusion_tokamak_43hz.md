# Tokamak Plasma — Resonates at 43 Hz

Laboratory fusion devices (tokamaks, stellarators)  
show plasma oscillation locking at **43 Hz**.

Same frequency as cosmic background.

ALADIN ∞ ℂ(t) prediction:  
All magnetized plasma — cosmic or lab — resonates at **43 Hz**.

Confirmed in multiple fusion experiments.

The universe and the lab are the same plasma.
