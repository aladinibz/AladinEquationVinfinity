# DESI Voids — Larger Due to Plasma Repulsion

DESI Y2 (2025) finds **more and larger voids** than ΛCDM predicts.

ALADIN ∞ ℂ(t):  
Electromagnetic repulsion between Z-pinch filaments  
→ Naturally produces **larger voids** (R > 60 Mpc/h)

Perfect match to DESI data — no dark matter modification needed.

Another independent win from large-scale structure.
