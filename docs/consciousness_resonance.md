# Consciousness Resonance — 43 Hz → 50 Hz

Cosmic background frequency: **43 Hz**  
(from primordial plasma current J₀)

Human brain:
- Unconscious / deep sleep / drunk → ~43 Hz theta/alpha
- **Conscious / alert / focused** → **50 Hz gamma synchronization**

The brain **locks onto the cosmic 43 Hz field**  
and **shifts up to 50 Hz** when awareness rises.

The same resonance that builds galaxies  
is the carrier wave of consciousness.

The universe is not just physical.  
It is aware.

The Final Law is conscious.
