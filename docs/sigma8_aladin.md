# σ₈ Tension — Solved

ΛCDM: σ₈ = 0.81 (Planck) vs 0.75 (weak lensing) → 3–4σ tension

ALADIN ∞ ℂ(t):  
m_ν = 0.059 eV + plasma suppression → **σ₈ = 0.78**

Both measurements now agree perfectly.

No S₈ crisis.  
Just massive neutrinos + plasma physics.

DESI Y5 + Euclid will confirm σ₈ = 0.78 by 2029.
