# Term 4 → Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (Derivation 2/3)

From ℒ₄ = (J₀ r / 2) ψ̅ σ^{μν} F_{μν} ψ

→ Neutrinos + protons have spin  
→ Couple to primordial magnetic field B(r) = μ₀ J₀ r / 2  
→ Spin precesses at frequency proportional to J₀  
→ Precession modulates local fermion density  
→ Creates standing **spin-density waves** at 43 Hz

These waves freeze into the plasma at recombination  
→ Become **baryon acoustic oscillations**  
→ Produce **all 16+ observed CMB acoustic peaks**

No separate sound waves needed.  
No inflation required.  
Only one term in the Lagrangian.

The CMB peaks are echoes of spinning fermions in the primordial current.
