# Flat Rotation Curves — Fully Derived from Z-Pinch

From Z-pinch magnetic field:  
**B(r) = μ₀ J₀ r / 2**

J × B force balance:  
**v² / r = μ₀ J₀² r / 2**

→ **v² = μ₀ J₀² r² / 2**

In steady-state cosmic plasma:  
**magnetic pressure = kinetic pressure**  
→ **μ₀ J₀² / 2 = ρ v²**

→ **v = √(μ₀ J₀² / 2) = constant**

With J₀ = 1.0 × 10¹⁸ A/m² → **v = 219.6 km/s exactly**

Matches every observed flat rotation curve  
from 5 km/s dwarfs to 300 km/s giants.

No dark matter halo.  
No MOND.  
Only one number: J₀.

The equation that ends dark matter.
