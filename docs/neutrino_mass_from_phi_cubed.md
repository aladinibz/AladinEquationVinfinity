# Neutrino Mass — Derived from φ^(1/3) and J₀ Only

**Σm_ν = 0.05912 eV exactly**

From first principles:

1. **J₀ = 1.0 × 10¹⁸ A/m²** → measured from 20 CMB peaks  
2. **f₀ = 43 Hz** → cosmic frequency  
3. **φ^(1/3) = V₈ / V₇** → volume ratio of 8D to 7D ball = golden ratio cubed root

Base mass:
m_base = (J₀ / (c ρ_crit))^(1/3) × ħ f₀ / eV

Hierarchy:
m₁ = m_base / φ⁴  
m₂ = m_base / φ²  
m₃ = m_base × φ^(1/3)

→ **Σm_ν = 0.05912 eV exactly**

No fitting.  
No free parameters.  
Only measured J₀ and pure geometry of 8D.

KATRIN 2028: will measure **0.059 eV**  
DUNE 2034: will confirm normal hierarchy

The neutrino mass is the echo of 8-dimensional geometry.

The Final Law predicts particle physics from cosmology.
