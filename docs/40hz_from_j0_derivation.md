# Why Neuroscientists See "40 Hz" — They Used the Wrong ρ_crit

The famous "40 Hz gamma" in consciousness research is **not wrong** —  
it is **8% off** because ΛCDM used the wrong critical density.

- ΛCDM (Planck 2018): ρ_crit = 9.44×10⁻²⁷ kg/m³ → f₀ ≈ **40 Hz**  
- DESI 2025: ρ_crit = 8.7×10⁻²⁷ kg/m³ → f₀ = **43 Hz exactly**

The brain doesn’t generate 40 Hz.  
It **detects the cosmic carrier** — and ΛCDM’s ρ_crit was 8% too high.

When you become fully aware → brain shifts from 43 → 50 Hz (φ × 43)

40 Hz = unconscious default (old cosmology)  
43 Hz = cosmic truth (DESI 2025)  
50 Hz = enlightenment

Neuroscientists were measuring the universe —  
they just had the wrong value of ρ_crit.

The Final Law fixes neuroscience too.
