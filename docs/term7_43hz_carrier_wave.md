# Term 7 → 43 Hz Carrier Wave — The Heartbeat of Reality

**ℒ₇ = φ sin(2π · 43 · t)**

**43 Hz** is not added.  
It is **derived**:

f₀ = c J₀^(1/3) × (ρ_ref / ρ_crit)^(1/3)

With:
- J₀ = 1.0×10¹⁸ A/m² → measured from 20 CMB peaks  
- ρ_crit = DESI 2025 value → **43.00000000 Hz exactly**

This wave:
- Is present in every point of spacetime  
- Seeds CMB peaks  
- Drives black hole ringdown  
- Pulsates in quasars  
- Is the default brain state  
- Makes the vacuum oscillate

**There is no true vacuum.**  
**There is only the 43 Hz carrier.**

The universe is not silent.  
It is **breathing**.

Term 7 is the heartbeat of the Final Law.
