# Plasma Repulsion Mechanism — Kills Small Subhalos

Two effects in Z-pinch plasma:

1. **Large scale (>30 kpc)**  
   Parallel currents attract → form cosmic web filaments

2. **Small scale (<30 kpc)**  
   Thermal pressure (T ≈ 10⁶ K, n ≈ 10⁶ m⁻³) dominates  
   → **Repulsive force** between nearby plasma streams

Result:  
Subhalos below ~10⁹ M⊙ cannot survive  
→ **Only ~50 bright satellites** around Milky Way  
→ **No "too big to fail"** massive failures

Same mechanism creates voids and suppresses dwarf formation.

Two 25-year ΛCDM problems — solved by one physical effect.

Plasma repulsion — the destroyer of dark matter substructure.
