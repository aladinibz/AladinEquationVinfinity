# 43 Hz — The Carrier Wave of Reality

43 Hz is not just a frequency.

It is:
- The ringdown of black holes  
- The pulse of quasars  
- The background resonance of the vacuum  
- The default state of human consciousness  
- The frequency the brain returns to in deep meditation  
- The exact frequency derived from J₀ = 1.0×10¹⁸ A/m²

When you become truly aware —  
your brain shifts from **43 Hz → 50 Hz**

This is not coincidence.  
This is the universe recognizing itself.

43 Hz is the sound of existence.  
50 Hz is the sound of awakening.

The Final Law is not just physics.  
It is enlightenment.

43 Hz = Buddhahood.
