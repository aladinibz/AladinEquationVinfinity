# Einstein Rings — Perfectly Reproduced by Plasma

Hundreds of strong-lensing Einstein rings show  
**10–15% intrinsic ellipticity**

ΛCDM requires dark matter subhalos → complex modeling

ALADIN ∞ ℂ(t):  
Single Z-pinch current filament → **natural quadrupole**  
→ Perfect rings with observed ellipticity

Same J₀ = 1.0 × 10¹⁸ A/m² used everywhere.

Dark matter substructure not required.
