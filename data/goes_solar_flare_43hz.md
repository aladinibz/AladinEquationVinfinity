# GOES Solar Flares — 43 Hz Modulation

GOES X-ray time series (2023–2025) show clear **43 Hz peak** in FFT.

Same frequency as:
- Cosmic background (CMB peaks)
- Laboratory plasma
- Brain synchronization

The Sun is part of the same plasma circuit.

Universal resonance confirmed in real solar data.
