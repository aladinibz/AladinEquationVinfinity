# High-Mass Tully-Fisher — MOND Fails

Ellipticals and galaxy clusters (M > 10¹² M⊙)  
→ MOND predicts **upward bend** in TF relation  
→ Observed: **perfect power law**

ALADIN ∞ ℂ(t):  
Z-pinch force ∝ v⁴ → **straight line forever**

No high-mass deviation.  
No MOND acceleration scale needed.

Another direct falsification of MOND.
