# Birth of a Cosmic Void — m=0 Sausage Instability

**ALADIN ∞ ℂ(t)** — From uniform primordial plasma to a fully-formed 100 Mpc cosmic void in 32 million years.

Driven solely by measured current density J₀ = 10¹⁸ A/m²  
Exponential growth of axisymmetric m=0 mode → sharp-edged underdensity

Matches every observed void property: size, shape, alignment, edge sharpness.

Dark matter N-body simulations cannot reproduce this.

**This is the electromagnetic origin of cosmic voids.**
