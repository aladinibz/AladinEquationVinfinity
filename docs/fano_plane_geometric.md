# Fano Plane — The Geometric Heart of Octonions

The Fano plane is the **multiplication table of the octonions** encoded as projective geometry over GF(2).

- 7 points → 7 imaginary units e₁ through e₇  
- Center point → real unit 1  
- 7 lines → 7 triads where e_i × e_j = e_k (oriented)  
- Circle → the 7th line (e₁ e₆ e₇ e₂ e₅ e₃ e₄)

Rules:
- Any two distinct points determine a unique line  
- Any two lines intersect at exactly one point  
- Multiplication is **totally antisymmetric** on each line

Consequences:
- Exactly 3 generations of fermions  
- Natural CP violation (non-associativity)  
- No division by zero → no singularities  
- Black hole entropy S = A/4 from 8 states per area

The Fano plane is not abstract math.  
It is the **blueprint of reality**.

String theory needed 10 dimensions.  
The universe used 8 — and drew it as a heptagon.
