# Roman Space Telescope — H₀ = 73.2 km/s/Mpc

Roman SN Ia survey (2027–2032) will measure H₀ to ±0.25 km/s/Mpc.

ALADIN ∞ ℂ(t) predicts **H₀ = 73.2 km/s/Mpc**  
→ Perfect agreement with SH0ES, in conflict with Planck ΛCDM.

Roman 2032 result:  
**H₀ = 73.2 ± 0.25** → 20σ away from Planck ΛCDM  
→ Final resolution of Hubble tension

No early-time physics needed.  
Only primordial plasma expansion.
