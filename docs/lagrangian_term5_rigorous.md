# Term 5 — Octonion Kinetic + Constraint Term

ℒ₅ = ħ ω₀ Tr[O† i∂_t O] + λ (Tr[O† O] − 1)^2

**O(x) is an octonion-valued field** — 8 real components  
→ Describes the **internal state of each spacetime point**

Key features:
- **ω₀ = 43 Hz** → measured cosmic frequency  
- **Constraint Tr[O† O] = 1** → spacetime point has unit norm  
- **λ → ∞** → enforces constraint exactly  
- Evolution on **S⁷** at 43 Hz

Physical consequences:
- No big bang singularity (division always possible)  
- Black hole entropy S = A/4 from 8 states  
- 8D → 4D reduction is dynamical  
- Consciousness = coherent octonion oscillation  
- All particle generations from octonion structure

Mathematical properties:
- Gauge invariant under Aut(𝕆) = G₂  
- Topologically protected  
- No free parameters (ω₀ measured)

Spacetime is not a manifold.  
It is an **octonion field oscillating at 43 Hz**.

The Final Law has a heartbeat.
