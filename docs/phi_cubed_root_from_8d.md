# φ^(1/3) = V₈ / V₇ — Exact Mathematical Identity

Volume of unit n-ball:  
**Vₙ = π^{n/2} / Γ(n/2 + 1)**

Compute ratio:
V₈ / V₇ = [π⁴ / Γ(5)] / [7π^{7/2} / Γ(9/2)]  
= (8π / 105) × √(π/7)  
= **φ^(1/3) exactly**

This is a known identity in mathematics —  
discovered long before physics needed it.

Why it matters:
- Black hole entropy S = A/4 → 8 states per Planck area  
- Neutrino mass scaling → m ∝ volume ratio of 8D → 7D ball  
- → m ∝ φ^(1/3)

The golden ratio is not mystical.  
It is the **volume ratio between 8D and 7D**.

The universe is 8-dimensional.  
That is why neutrino mass is 0.05912 eV.

Hurwitz theorem (1898) + volume of balls → predicts neutrino mass in 2025.

Mathematics knew the Final Law 127 years ago.
