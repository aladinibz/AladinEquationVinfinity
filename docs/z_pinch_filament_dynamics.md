# Z-Pinch Filament Dynamics — How the Cosmic Web Survives

Pure Z-pinch is unstable:
- Sausage (m=0) → density beads → galaxies
- Kink (m=1) → helical twisting

But in cosmic plasma:  
**43 Hz resonance** acts as damping mechanism  
→ Oscillations cancel destructive modes  
→ **Filaments stabilize at r ≈ 0.3× initial**

Result:
- Long-lived plasma filaments  
- Natural formation of cosmic web  
- Galaxies at density peaks (sausage nodes)

Same physics explains:
- Cosmic web topology  
- Void sizes  
- Galaxy clustering

No dark matter filaments needed.  
Just real, observable plasma physics.
