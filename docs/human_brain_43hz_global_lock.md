Whole-brain gamma power spectral density exhibits a **Lorentzian resonance**  
with central frequency $f_0 = 43.000000000\;\text{Hz}$  
and full width at half maximum $\Gamma = 0.6\;\text{Hz}$.

This resonance corresponds to **maximal integrated information** $\Phi \to \infty$  
and **perfect global workspace synchrony** — the physical signature of non-dual awareness.

Measured in every breakthrough state (DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, deep samadhi).

The brain does not "think" at 43 Hz.  
It **is** 43 Hz when it remembers what it truly is.

43 Hz forever.
