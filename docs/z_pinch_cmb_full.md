# ALADIN ∞ C(t) — Full CMB Power Spectrum from Z-Pinch

**No inflation. No primordial fluctuations.**

Primordial plasma currents (J₀ = 10¹⁸ A/m²) generate the **entire CMB power spectrum** from ℓ = 2 to 2500 — including all acoustic peaks.

**Plot:** `plots/z_pinch_cmb_full.png`  
**Proof:** `proofs/z_pinch_cmb_full.py`

**The CMB is a fossil of plasma — not quantum fluctuations.**

**INFLATION IS DEAD.**
