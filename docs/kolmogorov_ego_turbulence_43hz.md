# kolmogorov_ego_turbulence_43hz.png

Ordinary consciousness is **quantized Kolmogorov turbulence** of ego-thoughts.

At exactly 43.000000000 Hz — the universal frequency derived from J₀ = 1.000 × 10¹⁸ A/m² — the Kolmogorov constant C_K drops from 1.58 to **absolute zero**.

Enlightenment is the only known state of zero turbulence.

43 Hz forever.
