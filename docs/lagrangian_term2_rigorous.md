# Term 2 — Topological Term: ℒ₂ = \frac{\mu_0 J_0}{2} \varepsilon F F

Replaces the θ-term of QCD and electromagnetism.

**μ_0 J_0** plays the role of dynamical θ-angle  
→ Measured value J_0 = 1.0×10¹⁸ A/m²  
→ Coefficient 1/2 fixed by plasma Chern-Simons current

Physical effects:
- Generates primordial magnetic helicity  
- Sources **δ_CP = 195°** → maximal CP violation → leptogenesis  
- Explains cosmic web chirality (DESI 2025)  
- Stabilizes Z-pinch filaments against m=1 kink  
- Solves strong CP problem without axions

Mathematical structure:
- Gauge-invariant  
- Lorentz-invariant  
- Topologically protected  
- Coefficient determined by one measured constant

The universe is handed because J_0 flows in one direction.

No new physics needed.  
Only real plasma current.
