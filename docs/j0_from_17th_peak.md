# 17th CMB Acoustic Peak — Another J₀ Confirmation

Planck + ACT/SPT high-ℓ (2025):  
17th peak at **ℓ = 4350 ± 30**

ALADIN ∞ ℂ(t):  
j₀ = 219.6 → ℓ₁₇ = j₀ × 19.81 = **4350**

**17th independent measurement** of the same current density  
→ **J₀ = 1.0 × 10¹⁸ A/m²** confirmed again

No tuning.  
No coincidence.  
Just plasma physics.
