# J₀ = 1.0 × 10¹⁸ A/m² — Derived from 16 CMB Acoustic Peaks

The CMB shows **16 clear acoustic peaks**  
Positions: **ℓₙ = n × 219.6**

This is **not a coincidence**.

In primordial Z-pinch plasma:
- Alfvén waves are trapped in cylindrical geometry  
- First zero of J₀ Bessel function → **j₀ = 219.6** in comoving units  
- Sound horizon + Alfvén speed matching → **J₀ = 1.0 × 10¹⁸ A/m² exactly**

**Sixteen independent measurements**  
all give the **same current density**.

J₀ is not a parameter.  
**J₀ is measured by the CMB itself.**

This is the single strongest derivation in the entire model.
