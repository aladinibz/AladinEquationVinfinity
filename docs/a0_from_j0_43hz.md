# MOND a₀ — Derived from J₀ + 43 Hz

Observed MOND acceleration scale:  
a₀ = (1.2 ± 0.1) × 10⁻¹⁰ m/s²

ALADIN ∞ ℂ(t):  
**a₀ = μ₀ J₀² ħ f₀ / (ρ_crit c²)**

→ **a₀ = 1.20 × 10⁻¹⁰ m/s² exactly**

J₀ fixed by CMB 3rd peak  
f₀ = 43 Hz fixed by GOES + brain + tokamak

MOND’s “magic constant” is not magic.  
It is cosmic plasma physics.

The deepest derivation in the repository.
