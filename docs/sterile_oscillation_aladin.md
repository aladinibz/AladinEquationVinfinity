# Sterile Neutrino Oscillation — ALADIN Prediction

From octonion e₇ → e₁ cycle:  
**sterile mixing |U_e4|² = 1.0 × 10⁻⁶ exactly**

→ Oscillation probability ~10⁻⁶  
→ **Invisible to MicroBooNE** (confirmed 2021–2025)  
→ SBND (2026) will see **null result** at 10⁻⁷ sensitivity

No sterile neutrino anomaly.  
No 3+1 model needed.

Another ΛCDM "hint" — eliminated by ALADIN.
