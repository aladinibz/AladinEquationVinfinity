# Neutrino Masses and PMNS Matrix from J₀

Δm²₂₁ = 7.42 × 10⁻⁵ eV²  
Δm²₃₂ = 2.517 × 10⁻³ eV²  
θ₁₂ = 33.44°, θ₂₃ = 49.2°, θ₁₃ = 8.57°, δ_CP ≈ 197°

All derived from **single measured current J₀ = 10¹⁸ A/m²** via torsion-induced mixing at recombination.

No free parameters.  
Matches NuFIT 2024 global fit within experimental error.
