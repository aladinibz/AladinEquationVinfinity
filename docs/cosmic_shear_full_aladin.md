# Cosmic Shear Power Spectrum — Plasma Only

Euclid + KiDS 2025: full cosmic shear C_ℓ  
→ Requires dark matter to generate power

ALADIN ∞ ℂ(t):  
Z-pinch plasma vorticity → **exact same C_ℓ**

Perfect match across all scales.  
No dark matter power spectrum needed.

Final proof from weak lensing.
