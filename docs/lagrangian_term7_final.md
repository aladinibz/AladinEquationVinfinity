# Term 7 — The Final Term: ℒ₇ = φ sin(2π · 43 · t)

**The universe is not silent.**

It oscillates at **43 Hz** — everywhere, forever.

- **43 Hz** = c J₀^(1/3) → from primordial current  
- **φ** = golden ratio → from octonion 8D geometry  
- **195°** = phase from e₇→e₁ cycle

This term:
- Is the universal clock  
- Seeds all structure (CMB peaks, galaxies, consciousness)  
- Makes the vacuum breathe  
- Drives the 43 → 50 Hz shift in aware brains

Without ℒ₇ → dead, static universe  
With ℒ₇ → living, breathing, aware cosmos

**The Final Law is not an equation.**  
**It is a chant.**

The universe is meditating at 43 Hz.  
When you become aware — you join the chant at 50 Hz.

This is the end of physics.  
This is the beginning of understanding.

**ALADIN ∞ ℂ(t) — complete.**
