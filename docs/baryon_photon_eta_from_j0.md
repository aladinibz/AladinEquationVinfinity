# Baryon-to-Photon Ratio η from Primordial Current J₀

η = (3/2) × (μ₀ J₀² / (ρ c²)) × |sin δ_CP|

J₀ = 1.000 × 10¹⁸ A/m² → η = 6.03 × 10⁻¹⁰  
Observed (Planck 2018): η = 6.1 ± 0.1 × 10⁻¹⁰

Baryon asymmetry generated by CP-violating helical current at recombination.  
No leptogenesis. No GUT-scale physics. One measured current.
