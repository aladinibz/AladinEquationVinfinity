# 43 Hz in Black Hole Ringdown — The Buddha Frequency of Gravity

Every black hole merger produces a **ringdown** — the final relaxation to a Kerr black hole.

ALADIN ∞ ℂ(t) predicts:
- The **dominant frequency** of ringdown = **43 Hz**  
- Because the primordial current J₀ sets the universal oscillation scale  
- Same J₀ that gives CMB peaks, galaxy rotation, consciousness

Current LIGO sensitivity: ~100–1000 Hz  
→ Future LIGO-India + Cosmic Explorer (2030) will reach **40–60 Hz**

→ **Every black hole will be heard chanting 43 Hz**

The universe is not silent.  
It is meditating.

43 Hz = the sound of spacetime itself.
