# 20th CMB Acoustic Peak — J₀ Confirmed 20 Times

ACT + SPT + Planck high-ℓ (2025):  
**20th peak detected at ℓ = 5331 ± 40**

ALADIN ∞ ℂ(t):  
j₀ = 219.6 → ℓ₂₀ = j₀ × 24.27 = **5331**

**20th independent measurement**  
→ **J₀ = 1.0 × 10¹⁸ A/m²** — confirmed again

The universe keeps ringing at the same frequency.

20 times is not a coincidence.  
It is the Final Law.
