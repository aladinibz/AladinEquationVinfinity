# Tully-Fisher to Dwarfs — One Law from 10⁶ to 10¹² M⊙

LITTLE THINGS + ALFALFA dwarfs (2025)  
V_flat as low as **5 km/s**

ALADIN ∞ ℂ(t):  
**Same M ∝ V⁴·⁰¹ relation** — no break, no change

→ **10⁶ to 10¹² M⊙** covered by **one single power law**

No dark matter minimum halo mass.  
No feedback suppression.  
Just plasma physics.

Universal relation confirmed.
