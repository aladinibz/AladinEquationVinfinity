# JWST High-Redshift Galaxies — Explained

JWST finds galaxies up to **10¹¹ M⊙ at z=20+**  
→ Impossible in ΛCDM (too early, too massive)

ALADIN ∞ ℂ(t):
- Z-pinch compression  
- Neutrino self-gravity (m_ν=0.059 eV)  
→ Rapid structure formation at z>15

Prediction: **10¹¹ M⊙ galaxy at z=25 by 2027**

No "crisis" — just plasma physics.
