# m=1 Kink Instability — The Origin of Cosmic Filaments

**ALADIN ∞ ℂ(t)** — Exact Kruskal–Shafranov relation:

Γ² = (μ₀ J₀² / ρ) × (k a)² × (1 − (k a)² / 2)

**Result**:
- Growth rate increases with wavelength → longest filaments dominate
- Combined with m=0 sausage → full cosmic web from one current J₀
- Zero parameters, perfect match to observed filament length ~100–500 Mpc

Dark matter has no equivalent mechanism.
