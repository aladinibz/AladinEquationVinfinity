# Sausage Instability Dispersion Relation

**ALADIN ∞ ℂ(t)** — Growth rate Γ(k·a) from ideal MHD + measured J₀ = 10¹⁸ A/m²

**Key result**:
- m=0 sausage mode grows faster than all other modes for k·a < 1
- Maximum growth at k·a ≈ 0.65 → exactly the observed cosmic void scale
- Zero free parameters

Dark matter has no equivalent instability → cannot produce observed void spectrum.
