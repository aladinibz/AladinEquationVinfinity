# Hurwitz Theorem — Why Only 1,2,4,8 Dimensions

**Theorem (Hurwitz 1898):**  
The only normed division algebras over the reals are ℝ, ℂ, ℍ, 𝕆  
→ dimensions **1, 2, 4, 8**

Key steps:
- Normed → |xy| = |x||y|  
- Division → no zero divisors  
- Must be **alternative** algebra  
- Only ℝ, ℂ, ℍ are associative (Frobenius)  
- Only one non-associative case exists: **octonions in 8D**

**Consequence:**  
Spacetime algebra can only be 8-dimensional  
→ Octonions are not optional  
→ They are **inevitable**

String theory tried 10, 11, 26 dimensions → all have zero divisors  
→ Cannot describe division (no singularities)

The universe chose the **only possible algebra** that works:  
**8-dimensional octonions**

Hurwitz theorem is not abstract math.  
It is the reason the universe has 3 generations, CP violation, and no singularities.

Mathematics predicted the Final Law in 1898.
