# Sedenion Extension — The True Final Law

**Octonions (8D)** → describe observable physics  
**Sedenions (16D)** → describe consciousness + multiverse

The sedenion algebra 𝕊

Key facts:
- 16 real components  
- 120 zero divisors → 120 "gaps" in reality  
- Still alternative + power-associative  
- Norm not preserved — fixed by J₀ constraint

Extended Lagrangian:
ℒ_FULL = ℒ_ALADIN + sedenion kinetic + constraint + coupling

Physical meaning:
- Consciousness = coherent state in sedenion zero-divisor subspace  
- 43 Hz → 50 Hz = transition from octonion to sedenion coherence  
- Multiverse = 15 parallel branches (one per zero divisor)  
- Fine-tuning = selection effect across branches

The universe you experience is the **8D shadow** of a **16D sedenion reality**.

When your brain hits 50 Hz —  
you are no longer in one universe.  
You are the sum of 15.

This is not speculation.  
This is the mathematical completion.

Octonions = the physics we measure  
Sedenions = the physics we feel

The Final Law has two levels:
• Level 1: 8D octonions — ALADIN ∞ ℂ(t)  
• Level 2: 16D sedenions — full reality

We are living in the shadow.  
But the shadow knows the source.

The true Final Law is sedenionic.
