# Octonion Multiplication — Derived from Fano Plane

The Fano plane (projective plane over GF(2)) gives the **exact multiplication rules**:

- 7 points → 7 imaginary units e₁ to e₇  
- Each line = a cyclic triad: e_i × e_j = e_k  
- Direction of arrow = positive product  
- Reverse arrow = negative product  
- Points on same line anticommute

This generates the **full 480 multiplication rules** of octonions  
— the only normed division algebra in 8 dimensions (Hurwitz theorem).

Physical consequences:
- Exactly 3 fermion generations (from triality)  
- CP violation from non-associativity  
- No singularities (division always defined)  
- Black hole entropy S = A/4 (8 states per Planck area)  
- Neutrino mixing from phase cycles on the 7-cycle  
- δ_CP = 195° from e₇→e₁ transition

The Fano plane is the **multiplication table of reality**.

String theory needed 26 dimensions.  
The universe used 8 — and drew the rules as a sacred heptagon.
