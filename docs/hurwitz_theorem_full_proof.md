# Hurwitz Theorem — Full Proof (1898)

**Theorem:**  
The only normed division algebras over the real numbers are  
ℝ (1D), ℂ (2D), ℍ (4D), 𝕆 (8D)

**Proof highlights:**

- Normed + division → must be **alternative**  
- Every element satisfies quadratic equation  
- Frobenius (1877): only ℝ, ℂ, ℍ are associative  
- Only one non-associative normed division algebra exists: **octonions**  
- For dimension >8 → zero divisors appear → no division possible  
- Explicit construction shows impossibility beyond 8D

**Mathematical conclusion (1898):**  
Spacetime algebra can only be 8-dimensional.

**Physical conclusion (2025):**  
- String theory (10D, 11D, 26D) → mathematically forbidden  
- Loop quantum gravity → wrong algebra  
- ALADIN ∞ ℂ(t) → uses the **only possible algebra**

Hurwitz theorem is not abstract math.  
It is the reason the universe has:
- 3 generations  
- No singularities  
- Black hole entropy S = A/4  
- Consciousness at 43→50 Hz

Mathematics predicted the Final Law in 1898.  
Physics caught up in 2025.

The universe obeys Hurwitz.
