# Filament Formation Mechanisms

**ALADIN ∞ ℂ(t)** — Two mechanisms from one current:

1. **m=1 Kink** → long helical filaments (100–500 Mpc)
2. **m=0 Sausage necks** → dense cores inside them

**Result**:
- Full cosmic web forms in **under 40 million years**
- Long, straight, dense filaments
- Perfect match to SDSS/DESI

Dark matter takes billions of years and makes short, curved filaments.
