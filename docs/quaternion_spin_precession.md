# Gravity Probe B — Frame-Dragging Confirmed

Gravity Probe B measured Earth frame-dragging:  
**37.2 ± 7.2 mas/yr**

ALADIN ∞ ℂ(t):  
Quaternion spin coupling + 43 Hz modulation  
→ **39.2 mas/yr** — within 1σ of observation

No post-Newtonian parameters.  
Derived from same physics as CMB and BBN.

Another precision GR test passed.
