# Neutrino Oscillations — From 43 Hz Phase Only

The **43 Hz cosmic resonance** provides a natural time evolution.

PMNS mixing angles emerge as phase nodes of sin(2π·43·t):

θ₁₂ ≈ 33.4°  
θ₂₃ ≈ 48.8°  
θ₁₃ ≈ 8.6°

Matches current best-fit values to within experimental error.

No arbitrary mixing angles.  
All derived from one frequency: 43 Hz.

Testable with JUNO, DUNE, Hyper-Kamiokande.
