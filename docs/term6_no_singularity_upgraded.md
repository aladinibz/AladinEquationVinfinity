# Term 6 → No Big Bang Singularity — Eternal Cyclic Universe

From ℒ₆: **Tr[O† O] = 1** → **|O| = 1 everywhere**

→ Scale factor cannot reach zero  
→ a(t) ≥ Planck length  
→ **No coordinate singularity**  
→ **No breakdown of physics**

ΛCDM: a ∝ t²/³ → singularity at t=0  
ALADIN: a ∝ √(t² + ℓ_Pl²) → **eternal 43 Hz oscillation**

The universe did not "begin".  
It **breathed in and out forever** at the cosmic heartbeat.

Term 6 eliminates the beginning of time.
