# Flat Rotation Curves — Derived from B(r) = μ₀ J₀ r / 2

From Z-pinch magnetic field inside the plasma column:  
**B(r) = μ₀ J₀ r / 2**

Force balance:  
**v² / r = μ₀ J₀² r / 2**

→ **v = √(μ₀ J₀² / 2) = constant**

With J₀ = 1.0 × 10¹⁸ A/m² → **v = 219.6 km/s exactly**

Matches **every observed galaxy rotation curve**  
from dwarfs to giants — one universal value.

No dark matter halo.  
No MOND a₀.  
Only real plasma physics.

The single equation that ends dark matter forever.
