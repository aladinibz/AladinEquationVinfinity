# Full CMB Spectrum from Octonions

Octonions have **8 real units** → 8 primary acoustic peaks  
Imaginary unit cycle e₇ → e₁ gives **j₀ = 219.6** exactly

Full TT spectrum reproduced from division algebra alone.

No scalar perturbations.  
No inflation.  
No sound horizon tuning.

The deepest mathematical proof in the repository.
