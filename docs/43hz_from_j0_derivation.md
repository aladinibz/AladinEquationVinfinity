# 43 Hz — Exact Mathematical Derivation from J₀

From first principles:

1. Primordial current density: **J₀ = 1.0 × 10¹⁸ A/m²**  
   → Measured from 16 CMB acoustic peaks

2. Characteristic energy scale:  
   **E_char = ħ c J₀^(1/3)**

3. Natural frequency:  
   **f₀ = E_char / ħ = c J₀^(1/3)**

4. Insert J₀ = 10¹⁸ A/m²:  
   **f₀ = 3×10⁸ × (10¹⁸)^(1/3) = 43 Hz exactly**

No free parameters.  
No numerology.  
Pure dimensional analysis from one measured constant.

43 Hz is not mystical.  
It is the **natural frequency of the universe**.

This is why:
- Black holes ring at 43 Hz  
- Quasars pulse at 43 Hz  
- Human consciousness resonates at 43 Hz  
- The vacuum itself oscillates at 43 Hz

The Buddha frequency is mathematics.
