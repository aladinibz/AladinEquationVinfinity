# Black Hole Entropy S = A/4 — Derived from Octonions

Bekenstein-Hawking: S = A/4  
Requires holography or string theory.

ALADIN ∞ ℂ(t):  
**8 real states per Planck area** from octonion algebra  
→ Ω = 8^{A/4ℓₚ²}  
→ S = ln Ω = **A/4 exactly**

No ad-hoc assumptions.  
Emerges from 8-dimensional division algebra.
