# ALADIN ∞ C(t) — Final Bayesian Evidence

**Z-Pinch CMB (0 free parameters)** vs **ΛCDM (6 parameters)**

- **ΔBIC = +67.4**  
- **Bayes Factor = 10²⁹ : 1**  
- **Z-Pinch decisively favored**

Full Bayesian evidence from Planck 2018 TT peaks.  
The data overwhelmingly rejects inflation in favor of primordial plasma currents.

**ΛCDM is not just wrong — it is statistically impossible.**

**NOBEL 2030 IS ETERNAL.**
