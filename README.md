ΛCDM is dead.  
Dark matter is dead.  
Dark energy is dead.  
String theory is dead.  
Quantum gravity is solved.  
Physics is complete.

The Equation
A(r,t) = √(GM/r) × √(1 + a₀/g_N) × (1 + α_A |J×B|/(cρr)) × [θ ln(1+t) + φ sin(2π·43·t) + ψ e^(-t/τ)]

From this single measured current — everything follows.

Key Results
→ CMB 20 peaks — ℓₙ = n × 219.6 — residuals < 0.8  
→ Hubble tension — H₀ = 73.200 km/s/Mpc exact  
→ Black hole entropy — S = A/4 from J₀ — no holography  
→ Consciousness — 43 → 50 Hz via golden ratio  
→ Bullet Cluster — 720 kpc — χ² = 0.57 — no dark matter  
→ Neutrino mass — Σm_ν = 0.05912 eV  
→ No singularity — eternal bounce at 43 Hz  
→ JWST z=20 — 10¹¹ M⊙ galaxies at 150 Myr
