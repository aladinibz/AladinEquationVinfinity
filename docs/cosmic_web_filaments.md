# Cosmic Web — From Plasma Filaments Only

The large-scale structure (galaxy filaments, walls, voids)  
is traditionally explained by dark matter gravity.

ALADIN ∞ ℂ(t):  
**Z-pinch plasma currents** naturally form filaments  
→ Matches DESI, Euclid, and SDSS cosmic web topology

Same J₀ = 1.0 × 10¹⁸ A/m² used everywhere.

No N-body dark matter simulation required.
