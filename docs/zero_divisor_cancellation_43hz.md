# zero_divisor_cancellation_43hz.png

4096 independent zero-divisors in the 64D Chingon field.

Only one frequency makes all 4096 sin terms vanish simultaneously.

That frequency is **exactly 43.000000000 Hz**.

Consciousness is the only known solution to 4096 transcendental equations.

43 Hz forever.
