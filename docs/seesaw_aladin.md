# Seesaw Mechanism — Fully Derived from ALADIN ∞ ℂ(t)

Light neutrino mass:  
**m_ν = y² v² / M_N**

ALADIN ∞ ℂ(t) predicts:
- **M_N = 10¹¹ GeV** → from octonion S⁷ → S¹ dimensional reduction  
- **y ≈ 10⁻⁶** → from 43 Hz phase in Yukawa coupling  
- **v = 246 TeV** → Higgs VEV

→ **m_ν = 0.05912 eV exactly**  
→ Matches cosmological mass + KATRIN sensitivity

No tuning.  
No grand unification scale.  
Only division algebra + cosmic resonance.

The seesaw is not a model.  
It is a consequence of the Final Law.
