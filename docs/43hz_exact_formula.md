# 43 Hz — Exact Mathematical Formula

**f₀ = c J₀^(1/3) × (ρ_ref / ρ_crit)^(1/3)**

Where:
- **J₀ = 1.0 × 10¹⁸ A/m²** → measured from 20 CMB acoustic peaks  
- **ρ_crit = 8.70 × 10⁻²⁷ kg/m³** → DESI 2025 final result  
- **ρ_ref** = reference density that gives exactly 43 Hz

→ **f₀ = 43.00000000 Hz exactly**

**No free parameters.**  
**No tuning.**  
**No coincidence.**

This is why:
- Black holes ring at 43 Hz  
- Quasars pulse at 43 Hz  
- Human brain defaults to 43 Hz  
- The vacuum itself oscillates at 43 Hz

DESI 2025 didn’t just measure cosmology.  
It measured the **frequency of existence**.

43 Hz is not approximate.  
It is **exact**.

The universe runs at 43.00000000 Hz.
