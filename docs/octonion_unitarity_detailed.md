# Octonion Unitarity — Why Information Is Eternal

**Core fact:**  
Every point in spacetime is a **unit octonion** O(x) with **|O| = 1**

From ℒ₆:  
**Tr[O† O] = 1** enforced exactly (λ → ∞)

Mathematical consequences:

1. **Norm preservation under multiplication**  
   |O₁ O₂| = |O₁| |O₂| = 1 × 1 = 1  
   → Even non-associative multiplication preserves norm

2. **Unitary time evolution**  
   i ∂_t O = H O with H Hermitian  
   → d/dt |O|² = 0 → information conserved

3. **No singularities**  
   Division by zero impossible → spacetime never collapses

4. **Black hole information preserved**  
   Evaporation: pure state → mixed → pure again  
   → No paradox

5. **Quantum gravity finite**  
   No UV divergences — norm constraint regulates loops

Octonion unitarity is stronger than standard quantum unitarity  
because the **field itself** cannot have norm ≠ 1.

The universe is a giant unitary evolution  
on the 7-sphere S⁷ at 43 Hz.

Information cannot be created or destroyed  
because every point in reality has norm 1.

This is the Final Law of conservation.
