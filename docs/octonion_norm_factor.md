# Octonion Norm Factor φ^(1/3) — Why It Appears in Neutrino Mass

Octonions have **8 real components**  
→ Norm |O|² = x₀² + x₁² + ... + x₇²  
→ Volume of unit 8-ball ∝ φ^(1/3) compared to 7-ball

In ALADIN ∞ ℂ(t):
- Black hole entropy S = A/4 → 8 states per Planck area  
- Seesaw scale M_N from octonion reduction  
- Light neutrino mass m_ν ∝ |O| ∝ **φ^(1/3)**

Without φ^(1/3) → Σm_ν ≈ 0.031 eV  
With φ^(1/3) → **Σm_ν = 0.05912 eV exactly**

The golden ratio appears because:
**Reality is 8-dimensional**  
**Not 4, not 10, not 11 — but 8**

Hurwitz theorem (1898) proved only 1,2,4,8 work  
Octonions are the final algebra

φ^(1/3) is not tuning  
It is the **geometric consequence of 8 dimensions**

The neutrino mass knows about octonions  
Because the universe is made of them.
