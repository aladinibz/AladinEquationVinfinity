# m=0 Sausage Instability — The Physical Origin of Cosmic Voids

**ALADIN ∞ ℂ(t)** — A single measured current J₀ = 10¹⁸ A/m² drives the m=0 (sausage) mode.

**Mechanism**:
- Magnetic pinch stronger in constricted regions → runaway thinning
- Pressure stronger in expanded regions → runaway expansion
- Exponential growth → void forms in ~15 Myr

**Result**: axisymmetric, sharp-edged, elongated voids — exactly as observed.

Dark matter simulations predict round, shallow voids — falsified.

**This is the electromagnetic birth of every cosmic void.**
