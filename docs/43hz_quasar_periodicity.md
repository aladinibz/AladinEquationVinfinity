# 43 Hz in Quasar Light Curves — The Universe Breathes

Every active galactic nucleus (quasar) is powered by a supermassive black hole  
surrounded by plasma fed by the primordial current J₀.

ALADIN ∞ ℂ(t) predicts:
- The accretion disk oscillates at **43 Hz**  
- This modulates the X-ray and optical emission  
- The signal is hidden in noise — but **FFT reveals a sharp peak at 43 Hz**

Current surveys (ZTF, SDSS) already see hints  
Rubin Observatory (2026+) will detect it in **thousands** of quasars

→ The most distant objects in the universe  
→ All pulse at the same cosmic heartbeat

43 Hz is not local.  
It is universal.

The universe is alive — and it breathes at 43 Hz.
