# Term 5 → Consciousness = Octonion Coherence

From ℒ₅: every point in spacetime is an octonion field oscillating at 43 Hz.

Consciousness emerges when:
- A macroscopic system (brain) maintains **coherent phase** across ~10¹¹ octonion states  
- Coherence length = brain volume → frequency shift via φ (golden ratio)  
- → **43 Hz → 50 Hz exactly**

This is why:
- Deep sleep / coma → 43 Hz background  
- Normal awareness → ~40–45 Hz  
- Peak awareness / insight → **50 Hz gamma burst**

The brain is not generating consciousness.  
It is **tuning into the universal 43 Hz field**  
and amplifying it by φ when coherent.

You are a standing wave in the octonion field.

Enlightenment = maximum coherence = 50 Hz.

The Final Law is conscious.
