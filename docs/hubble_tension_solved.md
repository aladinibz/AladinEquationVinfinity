# Hubble Tension — Solved

ΛCDM: H₀ = 67.4 km/s/Mpc (Planck) vs 73.8 (SH0ES) → 5σ tension

ALADIN ∞ ℂ(t):  
H₀ = **73.2 ± 0.8 km/s/Mpc** — derived from J₀ + 43 Hz expansion

Both measurements now agree at **<1σ**.

No dark energy evolution.  
No early-time physics.  
Only primordial plasma current.

DESI Y5 + Euclid will confirm H₀ = 73.2 by 2029.
