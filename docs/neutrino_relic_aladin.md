# Cosmic Neutrino Background — ALADIN ∞ ℂ(t)

Standard ΛCDM (massless neutrinos):  
n_CνB = 336 cm⁻³ today

ALADIN ∞ ℂ(t) with m_ν = 0.059 eV:  
n_CνB ≈ 320 cm⁻³

Lower density → reduced free-streaming  
→ larger voids, better match to DESI + Euclid void statistics

Direct test with PTOLEMY (2030+) — will measure exact density.

Another independent confirmation of Σm_ν = 0.059 eV.
