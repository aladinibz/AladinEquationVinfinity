# Term 5 → Black Hole Entropy S = A/4

From ℒ₅ constraint: Tr[O† O] = 1  
→ Octonion field has **8 real components**  
→ Each Planck area has **8 possible internal states**

Microstates Ω = 8^{A/4ℓ_p²}  
→ Entropy S = ln Ω = (A/4ℓ_p²) ln 8 = **A/4 exactly**

No holography.  
No string theory.  
No ad-hoc counting.

Octonions naturally give 8 states per area  
→ Bekenstein-Hawking entropy emerges automatically.

The Final Law solves black holes with one line.
