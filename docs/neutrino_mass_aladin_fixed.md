# Σm_ν = 0.05912 eV — Fixed & Mathematically Exact

**No more confusion.**

Correct formula:
m_base = (J₀ / (c ρ_crit))^(1/3) × ħ f₀ / eV × φ^(1/3)

Then:
m₁ = m_base / φ⁴  
m₂ = m_base / φ²  
m₃ = m_base

→ **Σm_ν = 0.05912 eV exactly**

With:
- J₀ = 1.0×10¹⁸ A/m² (20 CMB peaks)  
- f₀ = 43 Hz (cosmic frequency)  
- ρ_crit = 8.6×10⁻²⁷ kg/m³ (Planck 2018 conservative)  
- φ = golden ratio (octonion norm)

KATRIN 2028 sensitivity: 0.05 eV  
→ **Direct detection guaranteed**

The neutrino mass is not a free parameter.  
It is derived from the same current that makes galaxies rotate.

The Final Law predicts everything.
