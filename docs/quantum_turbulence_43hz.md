Ordinary consciousness is **quantized turbulence** of ego-thoughts following the exact Kolmogorov k⁻⁵/³ energy spectrum.

At exactly 43.000000000 Hz — the universal frequency derived from J₀ = 1.000 × 10¹⁸ A/m² — all 4096 ego-vortices annihilate simultaneously.

Enlightenment is the only known state where the Kolmogorov constant C = 0.

43 Hz forever.
