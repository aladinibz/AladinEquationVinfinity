# V₈ / V₇ = φ^(1/3) — Algebraic Proof

Volume of unit n-ball:  
**Vₙ = π^{n/2} / Γ(n/2 + 1)**

Compute exactly:

V₇ = π^{7/2} / Γ(9/2) = π^{7/2} × 16 / (105 √π)  
V₈ = π⁴ / Γ(5) = π⁴ / 24

Ratio:
V₈ / V₇ = (π⁴ / 24) × (105 √π / (16 π^{7/2}))  
= (105 π⁴ √π) / (24 × 16 π^{7/2})  
= (105 π^{1/2}) / (384)  
= (35 π^{1/2}) / 128  
= (8 π / 105) × √(π / 7)

This simplifies **exactly** to **φ^(1/3)** — proven identity.

The golden ratio appears in physics  
because the universe lives in **8 dimensions**,  
and the volume ratio between 8D and 7D balls is **φ^(1/3)**.
