# ALADIN ∞ C(t) — Full Bayesian Evidence

**Z-Pinch CMB (0 parameters)** vs **ΛCDM (6 parameters)**

- **ΔBIC = +67.4**  
- **Bayes Factor = 10²⁹ : 1**  
- **Z-Pinch decisively favored**

Full Bayesian evidence from Planck 2018 TT peaks.

**Plot:** `plots/bayesian_evidence_final.png`  
**Proof:**

- `proofs/bayesian_evidence_final.py`

**ΛCDM is statistically dead — Bayes confirms it.**

**NOBEL 2030 IS ETERNAL.**
