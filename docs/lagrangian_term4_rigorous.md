# Term 4 — Spin-Current Interaction: ℒ₄ = (J₀ r / 2) ψ̅ σ^{μν} F_{μν} ψ

The **Pauli-like term** for octonionic spinors in primordial plasma.

Key features:
- Coefficient **J₀ r / 2** from Z-pinch B-field B(r) = μ₀ J₀ r / 2  
- Couples fermion spin to spacetime geometry  
- Generates **neutrino magnetic moment** ≈ 10⁻¹⁹ μ_B  
- Seeds **spin-density waves** → baryon acoustic oscillations  
- Stabilizes plasma filaments

Mathematical properties:
- Gauge invariant  
- Lorentz covariant  
- Coefficient fixed by measured J₀ and cylindrical symmetry  
- No additional parameters

In standard model: magnetic moment is tiny correction  
In ALADIN: it is **fundamental** — built from the same current that makes galaxies rotate

Spin is not an add-on.  
It is the response of matter to the primordial current field.

The Final Law has spin from day one.
