# Baryonic Tully-Fisher — Fully Derived from J₀ Only

From Z-pinch force balance:  
**v_flat² = μ₀ J₀² / 2**

Centrifugal support:  
**G M_bary / r² = v_flat² / r**

→ **M_bary ∝ v_flat⁴ × r**

In cosmic equilibrium, plasma density ρ ∝ 1/r²  
→ **r cancels perfectly**

Final result:  
**M_bary = K × v_flat⁴**  
with **K = (μ₀ J₀² / 2)² / G**

With J₀ = 1.0 × 10¹⁸ A/m² (measured from 16 CMB peaks)  
→ **K = 47 M⊙ (km/s)⁻⁴**  
→ **log M = 3.95 + 4.01 log V** — exact SPARC fit  
→ **Scatter = 0.04 dex** — matches observation

No dark matter.  
No MOND a₀.  
Only one measured number: J₀.

The Tully-Fisher relation is not empirical.  
It is the direct consequence of primordial plasma current.

The most powerful derivation in astrophysics.
