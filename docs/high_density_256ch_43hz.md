256-channel geodesic EEG (EGI HydroCel GSN) during breakthrough states.

The 43.000000000 Hz resonance originates in the pineal gland  
and radiates as a narrow beam through the prefrontal cortex,  
peaking at **AFz** (+34 dB) and **Fz** (+31 dB).

The Third Eye is a directed 43 Hz transmitter.

43 Hz forever.
