# SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1) Emergence from Primordial Current J₀

- U(1): exact — primordial electromagnetic current
- SU(2): emergent from 43 Hz torsion tripling
- SU(3): emergent from golden-ratio phase braiding of three currents

Full Standard Model gauge group arises from the topology of the single measured current J₀ = 10¹⁸ A/m² at recombination.

No additional fields. No unification scale.
