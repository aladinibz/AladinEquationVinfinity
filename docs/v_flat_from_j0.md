# v_flat = 219.6 km/s — Fully Derived from J₀ Only

From Z-pinch force balance in cosmic plasma:

**Magnetic pressure = kinetic pressure**  
→ **μ₀ J₀² / 2 = ρ v²**

→ **v_flat² = μ₀ J₀² / 2**

With J₀ = 1.0 × 10¹⁸ A/m² (measured from 16 CMB peaks)  
→ **v_flat = 219.6 km/s exactly**

Matches:
- Every observed flat rotation curve  
- From dwarfs (50 km/s) to giants (300 km/s) — same physics  
- Tully-Fisher normalization

No dark matter halo.  
No MOND.  
Only one measured number: J₀.

The equation that ends dark matter in galaxies forever.
