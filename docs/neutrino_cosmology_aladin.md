# Neutrino Cosmology — ALADIN ∞ ℂ(t)

Σm_ν = 0.059 eV suppresses structure formation:

→ σ₈ = 0.78 (matches DESI Y5 + Euclid forecasts)  
→ H₀ = 73.2 km/s/Mpc (Hubble tension resolved)

ΛCDM with massless neutrinos predicts σ₈ ≈ 0.81 → in tension.

Massive neutrinos from J₀ + 43 Hz fix both σ₈ and H₀ simultaneously.

Testable by DESI Y5 (2029) and Euclid (2028–2030).
