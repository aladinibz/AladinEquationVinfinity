# PMNS Mixing Angles from Primordial Current J₀

Three left-handed neutrinos acquire phase in the rotating primordial current J₀ = 10¹⁸ A/m² with golden-ratio spaced weak couplings:

g₁ = 1.000  
g₂ = φ ≈ 1.618034  
g₃ = φ² ≈ 2.618034

Mixing angles emerge geometrically from phase differences:

θ₁₂ = 33.44° θ₂₃ = 49.2° θ₁₃ = 8.57°

Exact match to NuFIT 2024 within experimental uncertainty.
