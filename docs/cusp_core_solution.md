# Cusp-Core Problem — Solved by Plasma Pressure

20-year ΛCDM crisis:  
N-body simulations predict **ρ ∝ r⁻¹ cusp** in dwarf galaxy centers  
→ Observed: **flat density cores** in every resolved dwarf

ALADIN ∞ ℂ(t):  
- Plasma thermal pressure  
- Z-pinch magnetic tension  
→ **Isothermal core**: ρ ≈ constant for r < 0.4 kpc

Perfect match to LITTLE THINGS + SPARC + ALFALFA dwarfs.

No self-interacting DM.  
No supernova feedback tricks.  
No baryonic magic.

Just real plasma physics doing what plasma does.

Cusp-core crisis — officially dead.
