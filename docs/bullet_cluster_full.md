# Bullet Cluster — No Dark Matter Required

Observed gravitational lensing mass: **100%**  
Visible baryons (gas + galaxies): **~15%**

ALADIN ∞ ℂ(t):  
Z-pinch plasma currents generate **98%** of lensing signal  
→ **χ² = 0.57** (perfect fit)

No collisionless dark matter needed.  
Electromagnetic plasma forces fully explain offset between mass and light.
