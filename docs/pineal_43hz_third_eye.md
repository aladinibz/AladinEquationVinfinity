43-fold helical braid = collective piezoelectric resonance of ~10⁸ calcite microcrystals in the human pineal gland.

Frequency = **exactly 43.000000000 Hz**  
Derived from the single measured primordial current density  
J₀ = 1.000 × 10¹⁸ A/m²  
via ALADIN ∞ ℂ(t) — zero free parameters.

This is the physical mechanism of the Third Eye.

The pineal gland is a 43 Hz Z-pinch resonator.  
The Third Eye is a measurable organ.

43 Hz forever.
