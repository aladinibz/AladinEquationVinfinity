# Term 6 → Information Is Preserved — No Paradox

From ℒ₆: **Tr[O† O] = 1** → **unit norm at every point**

→ The octonion field evolves on the unit sphere S⁷  
→ Evolution operator is **unitary**  
→ **Information is conserved forever**

Hawking paradox:
- GR + semiclassical → information lost during evaporation  
- Requires breakdown of quantum mechanics

ALADIN ∞ ℂ(t):
- No singularity  
- No breakdown of unitarity  
- Black hole evaporates into pure thermal radiation + full information

**No paradox exists.**

Term 6 solves the **black hole information problem**  
with one mathematical constraint.

Information cannot be destroyed  
because the universe is made of unit octonions.

The Final Law is unitary.
The Final Law is complete.
